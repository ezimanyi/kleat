# kleat

Kleat is tool for managing Spinnaker configuration files that is intended to
replace Halyard. Please see the
[RFC](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/halyard-lite.md)

It is currently under active development and is not ready for production (or
even development) use, but stay tuned for updates!
